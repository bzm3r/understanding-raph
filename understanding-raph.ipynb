    "Now, suppose that we were interested in producing not only the total, but a *prefix sum*. Given a list of $n$ numbers, produce a list of $n$ numbers, so that the $i$th element of the list is sum of elements with index, $0, ..., i$ from the input list. The last element of such a list would be the the total. The sequential solution is easy: simply push each $S_i$ into a list, and return this, instead of only $S_{n}$. It requires a little more thought to parallelize the algorithm, however, because now there is some state dependency. If $L_n$ is the result list, then clearly $L_i$ depends upon $L_{i - 1}$, and it would seem then that the problem must be executed sequentially, as we must compute $L_{i - 1}$ to get $L_i$. However, a little more thought can convince us that we could still break the problem down into pieces, and combine the result of each piece into the final solution.

So, there is a close connection between the state of the stack, and the output format we chose. The output allows us to reconstruct the state of the stack at any given step: starting from item $i$ in the output, if we follow the parents, we can reconstruct the state of the stack at the `i`th step.
