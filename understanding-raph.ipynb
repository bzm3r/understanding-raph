Initially, $S_0 = 0$, and when the next element is encountered, we add it to $S_0$ to get $S_1$, and finally $S_n$ will be returned, where $n$ is the length of the input list. In total, this algorithm would take $S_{n + 1}$ steps to execute.\n",

Given a list of $n$ numbers, produce a list of $n$ numbers, so that the $i$th element of the list is sum of elements with index, $0, ..., i$ from the input list. The last element of such a list would be the the total. The sequential solution is easy: simply push each $S_i$ into a list, and return this, instead of only $S_{n}$. It requires a little more thought to parallelize the algorithm, however, because now there is some state dependency. If $L_n$ is the result list, then clearly $L_i$ depends upon $L_{i - 1}$, and it would seem then that the problem must be executed sequentially, as we must compute $L_{i - 1}$ to get $L_i$. However, a little more thought can convince us that we could still break the problem down into pieces, and combine the result of each piece into the final solution.

So, there is a close connection between the state of the stack, and the output format we chose. The output allows us to reconstruct the state of the stack at any given step: starting from item $i$ in the output, if we follow the parents, we can reconstruct the state of the stack at the `i`th step. For example, follow the parents from `output[5]`, and keep track of the parents encountered so far:\n",

The identity must be `Stk(0, [])`: pop zero elements and push nothing. `Stk(0, [i])` models a `(` at position `i`, while `Stk(1, [])` models a `)`. \n",

    "Given two stack-transform elements `(a, xs)` and `(b, ys)`, how should they be combined? Suppose our stack is currently `S`. The first element will pop the stack `a` times, and then push `xs`.

In total, `S` would be popped `a + (b - len(xs))` times. Then, we would push on `ys`. So, the net transformation would be `Stk(a + (b - len(xs)), ys)`. If `b < len(xs)`, we effectively only push `xs[:len(xs) - b]` indices onto the stack (i.e. `xs` without the last `b` elements. Then, we push `ys`. So, the net transformation would be `Stk(a, xs[:(len(xs) - b)] + ys)`. Putting the two cases together:\n",

    "Note that `Bic` has a 1-to-1 match with the bicyclic monoid. It has two non-identity primitive elements, and `Bic(0, 1) ; Bic(1, 0) == Bic(0, 0)`. It is easy to show that any combination of three primitive elements is associative, so the general associativity of `;` follows from this, by induction."
